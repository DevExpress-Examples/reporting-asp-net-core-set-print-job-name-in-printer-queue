## Web Document Viewer - How to change the name of a print job in printer queue

In desktop applications, the name of a report in printer queue is taken from the [XtraReport.DisplayName](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport.DisplayName) property value. You can override it in the XtraReport.PrintingSystem.StartPrint event handler by specifying the DevExpress.XtraPrinting.PrintDocumentEventArgs.PrintDocument.DocumentName property.

When printing reports using Web Document Viewer, these settings won't take effect because web printing is PDF-based: see [specifics of web printing](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/5196/create-end-user-reporting-applications/web-reporting/asp-net-webforms-reporting/print-and-export/print-overview). 
Web Document Viewer takes the reporting print job name from the HTTP Handler Module that is used to communicate with the server. 
To change the reporting print job name, create a custom controller action with the required print job name and call it in a custom IWebDocumentViewerExportResultUriGenerator service's IWebDocumentViewerExportResultUriGenerator.CreateUri method.
